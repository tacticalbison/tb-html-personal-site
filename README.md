## Things I learned in this section

**<u>Tables:</u>** Using pure HTML, tables can help with formatting of sites and placement of elements. Angela's example of setting up a table to design the header was very insightful. Sort of like doing CSS without the CSS file.

**<u>Forms:</u>** Pure HTML forms are somewhat limited (JavaScript can be utilized to unlock a lot of actions and make the forms responsive.)

**<u>Unicode:</u>** Encoding of websites and other online content is important. Content-type and charset tags need close attention, especially for internationally used applications/sites. Ensure that the `<meta>` tag is very close to the top of the html code to ensure encoding is done appropriately.

**<u>Personal notes</u>**: I would recommend these sections of this course to anyone wanting to get a refresher of basic HTML. I intentionally took these sections to expose myself to more pure HTML coding. I am grateful as, combined with past experience in JavaScript, I can see connections I wasn't able to fully understand before. An example: I had known that you can set actions of a form using JavaScript, but did not realize that basic actions could also be done in pure HTML. Understanding the foundations will only unlock more knowledge for me in the future.
